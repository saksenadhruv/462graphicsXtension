{"name":"462graphicsXtension","tagline":"Assignment 5 of graphics - by Dhruv Saksena (dsaksena)","body":"# \r\n***\r\n### Proposal\r\n1. I will be working alone, focusing on implementing Photon Mapping in option F: Advanced Monte Carlo Rendering. Reading the wiki I expect it to be a 2 step process. My extension will be implementing these 2 steps fully.\r\n    * First Pass send a packet of photons from the light source and make a cache for results (photons eliminated using Russian Roulette) Cache modeled as a KD-tree as proposed by wiki.\r\n    * Second Pass calculate indirect illumination using photon map. Using KNN algo.\r\n2. If instructors agree I will have full credit on implementing photon mapping correctly and then I would like to work on extra credit (because I need it and want it :) )\r\n\r\n3. I will firstly work on **bidirectional path tracing** as extra credit.\r\n\r\n4. Secondly, since I was a 418 student, I shall like to implement **Efficient BVH Construction via Approximate Agglomerative Clustering** for more extra credit.\r\n\r\n5. I really don't expect to reach here but if I do I like **Option I: kPhone 869 (15-869 Assignment)** especially since I will join Apple GPU Compute team to work on Iphones. More extra credit I hope.\r\n\r\n\r\nIf the instructors agree to this proposal great, otherwise if they feel photon mapping is not enough workload I can do **bidirectional path tracing** or **Efficient BVH Construction via Approximate Agglomerative Clustering** for normal credit as well.","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
